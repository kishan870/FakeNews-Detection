In this project, we make use of the dataset provided by FakeNewsNet and build an LSTM model that can classify a news article as genuine or fake. We preprocess the news articles in the dataset using NLP techniques such as tokenization and removing the stop words. Later, we transform the text into sequences, convert sequences into PyTorch tensors, and train the LSTM model with the tensors as input. We used hyperparameter tuning to get the optimal model and evaluated the model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F-1 score. We integrated the model into a web app using the Python Flask web framework which will enable users to provide a news article as input and get the prediction as real or fake.
